# SSS (Simple Style Sheet)

SSS aims at being a simple and readable style sheet. It's inspired by:

* http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/
* The reader mode embedded in [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages) and [Internet Explorer](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2014/03/04/introducing-reading-view-in-ie-11/)

The goal is for the style sheet to produce an elegant rendering with a minimum of declarations (without any hard limit).
